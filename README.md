# Final Project for ds102/ds104_Data visualization on HDB resales flat price
### Introduction:
About 80% of Singaporeans stay in a HDB flat. Since the first introduction of the cooling measure in 2010, HDB resale flat price has been quite stabilize. Let see if we can forecast how the HDB resale price will be moving just by visualizing the data collected from past years.
### Objective:
- using dataset downloaded from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices)
- to derive insight from the dataset
- using [OneMap.sg API](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/docs/) to get the geographical location of the resales flat, MRT Station and calculate distance between the flat and the nearest MRT Station
### Required Library:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- [Geopy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/)
